            Hi! I'm Aubree, and I created SunLight Ortho with my family in mind. My journey into Ortho-Bionomy began when I
            was seven months pregnant and struggling with crippling sciatic pain. After just one session, the pain
            disappeared—and it never came back. That powerful experience opened my eyes to the body’s incredible ability to
            heal.
            <br><br>
            As I became a mother, I turned to this gentle form of healing to help my children—and was amazed by the results.
            What started as a personal solution quickly became a passion. I love the genuine connection that forms with each
            client, and it's my mission to bring comfort, alignment, and hope to as many people as I can—one healing session at
            a time.
